They were pioneers in our family history. From the beginning, their commitment was clear: to produce 100% natural honey, always respecting the balance of nature and the well-being of the bees.",
        "text-2": "Over the years, that passion passed from generation to generation, until our family decided to continue the tradition in Cruz del Eje, C贸rdoba. Thus, Corona Roja was born, with the same purpose as always: to bring pure honey to your table, without additives or industrial processes, made with the same care and love as always.",
        "subtitle-1": "From our family to yours.",
        "text-3": "We ourselves take care of the entire process; from our apiaries, we harvest and package each jar of honey to ensure that it reaches every home with its authentic flavor and all its properties intact. We believe in artisanal work and the importance of offering you a truly natural product, without shortcuts or chemicals that alter its quality.",
        "subtitle-2": "More than honey, a commitment.",
        "text-4": "What began as a family production now reaches homes, businesses, and industries that seek quality and trust in every jar. We know that when you choose our honey, you are not only looking for a good product, but also a story of tradition and respect for nature.",
